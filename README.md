# Carbonrs üñºÔ∏è

**A CLI tool for generating beautiful, customizable code snippet images** - right from your terminal. Inspired by [carbon.now.sh](https://carbon.now.sh), Carbonrs lets you create stunning visuals of your code with syntax highlighting, customizable fonts, themes, sizes, and more.

</div>

---

## Overview

Carbonrs is written in Rust and leverages powerful libraries:

- **`syntect`**: For syntax highlighting
- **`image`/`imageproc`**: For drawing
- **`ab_glyph`**: For font rendering

The goal is to provide a **fast, lightweight**, and fully customizable CLI experience that replicates and extends the functionality of [carbon.now.sh](https://carbon.now.sh).

---

## Features

- **Command-Line Interface**: Generate images directly from your terminal.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Uses `syntect` for accurate and beautiful code highlighting.
- **Customizable Appearance**:
  - Change fonts (with support for custom fonts).
  - Switch between themes.
  - Adjust font sizes and image dimensions.
- **Simulated Window Controls**: Optionally render macOS-style window buttons (red, yellow, green).
- **Fast & Lightweight**: Built in Rust for optimal performance.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Rust](https://rustup.rs) installed.

### Install via Cargo

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/dantescur/carbonrs
```

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dantescur/carbonrs.git
cd carbonrs
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be available in the `target/release` directory.

---

## Usage

Carbonrs is designed to be simple and straightforward. At its core, it converts a source code file into an image with highlighted syntax.

### Basic Command

```bash
carbonrs path/to/your/code_file --output path/to/output_image.png
```

If you do not specify an output file, it defaults to `output.png`.

### Example

To generate an image from `src/main.rs` and save it as `my_code.png`:

```bash
carbonrs src/main.rs --output my_code.png
```

---

## Customization

Carbonrs aims to offer extensive customization options, both now and in future releases:

### Fonts

- **Current**: Embedded Fira Code Nerd Font Mono.
- **Planned**: Support for custom fonts.

### Themes

- **Default**: `base16-ocean.dark`.
- **Planned**: Additional built-in themes and support for user-defined themes.

### Sizes & Layout

- Customize font size, line height, and image dimensions.

### Window Controls

- Optional macOS-style window controls (red, yellow, green buttons).
- Planned customization options for these controls.

> **Note:** Many of these options will be made available through CLI flags or a configuration file in upcoming releases.

---

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic CLI functionality for generating code snippet images.
- [ ] Support for dynamic font selection.
- [ ] Additional themes and support for user-defined themes.
- [ ] Enhanced customization for background colors, window controls, and overall layout.
- [ ] Better handling of diverse file types and languages.
- [ ] Integration with configuration files for persistent settings.
